    "### The Role of Next-Word Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core mechanisms that allows LLMs to generate coherent responses is **next-word prediction**. This technique transforms text generation into a probability problem, where the network receives a set of words (or tokens) and uses its internal knowledge to estimate which word is most likely to follow. This estimation is based on what the network learned during training with billions or even trillions of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal Mechanics and Probability Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stage in text generation involves using a **Softmax layer**, which converts the values (logits) produced by the model into probabilities. In simple terms, the model assigns a score to every word in its vocabulary; through Softmax, these scores are transformed into a probability distribution. The word with the highest probability is typically chosen as the next word, although other approaches—such as **sampling** or **beam search**—can be used to diversify the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "An illustrative example in pseudo-code can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simplified representation of the generation step\n",
    "logits = model(input_tokens)\n",
    "probabilities = softmax(logits)\n",
    "next_word = choose_token(probabilities)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated iteratively, allowing the LLM to compose complete sentences and paragraphs with semantic coherence based on the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Mechanism Works\n",
    "The effectiveness of **next-word prediction** lies in the model's ability to capture linguistic patterns and complex semantic relationships. During training, the **Transformer architecture**, through its **attention layers**, learns to recognize the role of each word within the context of its neighbors. Thus, even though future choices depend solely on probabilities, these probabilities carry deep information about grammar, style, and context, allowing for responses that, while statistically generated, closely approximate human patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is one of the major innovations in the field of artificial intelligence; by transforming the task of writing into a prediction problem, LLMs can handle a wide variety of contexts and produce surprisingly coherent and informative results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Considerations\n",
    "Although the prediction method is extremely powerful, it also presents challenges, such as the risk of generating nonsensical answers (**hallucinations**) when the context is not well-defined. Because of this, the architecture itself and its attention mechanisms must be finely tuned, and additional techniques can be applied to improve the fidelity and relevance of the generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deeply exploring how **next-word projection** works can help us better understand not only the capabilities of LLMs but also their limitations, pointing toward paths for continuous improvements in this technology."
